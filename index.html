          <h2>Price correlation of ETH against Bitcoin 9-4-2021 to 11-5-2021</h2>
          <p>   Initial thoughts: "Apart from a few outlier memecoins and some DEFI protocols, top cryptocurrencies are very closely correlated with Bitcoin."  </p>

          <p>    Normally when comparing the correlation between two items, any number between 0.7 to 1.0 indicates a strong positive
            correlation; in other words, between those two numbers, itâ€™s a really strong likelihood that you have a powerful 
            relationship between the two.. The correlation comparisons I ran between Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum(ETH), SHIBA(SHIB), Chainlink(LINK),
            and Dogecoin(DOGE) showed very strong correlations with BTC prices between 9/4/2021 and 11-5-2021. BTC and ETH corr was 0.9 from this
            selected time period, BTC and LINK was 0.54, BTC/SHIB at 0.8, BTC/DOGE at 0.55, and AAVE/BTC at 0.05, respectively.</p>
          
          <p>   We can see there are some strong and some weak relationships here. It looks like some coins are tidally locked to BTC and that some maybe decoupled completely.
            A deeper dive on DEFI coins and their correlations to BTC and ETC could yield some insight on whats orbiting what, and how strong is the gravity of each object. 
            I am actually surprized to see any weak correlations with BTC at all. 
          </p>

          <p>    Bitcoin dominance is calculated as: Total Market Cap/BTC Market Capitalization = BTC Dominance. But... Bitcoin's 
            dominance really digs deeper into the cryptoverse, any leveraged crypto trader can attest to this. BTC moves cause price movement
              across most crypto markets. Looking into these correlations might give a trader concerned with risk management some edge in balancing risk exposure.</p>


          <p>  Mapping these correlations could lead to a trading strategy where one opens a long position on a BTC move up and based on some scale of how correleated BTC 
            and other coins are, open a short on another coin that does poorly on a BTC up move, then flip bias at BTC top and short BTC but long the negatively correlated
             asset to hedge??
          </p>
          <p>             Concluding Thoughts: "Not everything was as i expected and BTC maybe losing its influence over certain crypto assets, at least in these market conditions"
